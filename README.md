# Reaction-Diffusion-FEM
My project for Will Mitchell's Partial Differential Equations class. I coded up a finite-element solver for reaction-diffusion PDEs. The paper is in the "paper" folder, the code is in the "src" folder, and notebooks that implement the code and make the figures in the paper are in the "notebooks" folder.
